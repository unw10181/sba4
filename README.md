Reflection:
I ran into a few challenges during this project, mainly around using local storage because I wasn’t familiar with how to store and retrieve arrays in JavaScript. Throughout the project I found that it was very easy to mistype htmlID when linking in JS. The filter function also kept glitching, which made it harder to test the rest of the features. Mapping out the project step by step helped me understand the logic better, especially when building the displayTasks function. That part was the most tedious because every object attribute needed to render correctly on the page. If I had more time, I would improve the code structure, clean up the logic, and make the UI more organized. Examples of better code would be utilizing for each loop instead of iterating in for loop. However, I kept having syntax issues whenever I used that approach. Overall this project gave me a deeper insight into DOM manipulation and JS.
